Sweet and sour sauce,stovetop,,"Heat up vegetable oil in pan or wok; add garlic, green onions and ginger to stir-fry for around 2 minutes or until aroma with low fire.

Then pour the basic sauce to the wok, bring all the content to a boiling. And add water starch in. Keep on stirring in the process.

Add veggies to wok after sauce boils, so the sauce coats the veggies, but they're not swimming. Add a few scoops of rice if too goopy. Cook on high heat until most of the goopiness is gone and the veggies begin to brown. 

Serve over rice that has 1 tablespoon soy sauce to 1 cup rice.",http://www.chinasichuanfood.com/chinese-sweet-and-sour-sauce/,,,
